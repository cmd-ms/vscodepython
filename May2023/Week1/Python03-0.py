#String formatting

#Here are some basic argument specifiers you should know:

#%s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)

#%d - Integers

#%f - Floating point numbers

#%.<number of digits>f - Floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot.

#%x/%X - Integers in hex representation (lowercase/uppercase)


#Python uses C-style string formatting to create new, formatted strings. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s" and "%d".
#Let's say you have a variable called "name" with your user name in it, and you would then like to print(out a greeting to that user.)

# This prints out "Hello, John!"
name = "John"
print("Hello, %s!" % name)

# This prints out "John is 23 years old."
age = 23
print("%s is %d years old." % (name, age))

# This prints out: A list: [1, 2, 3]
mylist = [1,2,3]
print("A list: %s" % mylist)

#Exercise
#You will need to write a format string which prints out the data using the following syntax: Hello John Doe. Your current balance is $53.44.
data = ("John", "Doe", 53.44)
format_string = "Hello %s %s. Your current balance is Â£%s."
print(format_string % data)
